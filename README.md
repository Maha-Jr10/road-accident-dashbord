# 🚦 UK Road Safety Dashboard (2021–2022)

## 📖 Project Overview

This project transforms a massive government dataset of **307,973 rows** into a high-performance business intelligence tool. As a simulated Head of Road Safety for the UK Department for Transport, I developed this dashboard to identify critical accident patterns and provide actionable insights to improve public safety.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

* **Advanced Data Cleaning:** Processed over 300k records using **Power Query** to handle missing values, format dates, and standardize categories.
* **Big Data Management:** Optimized a large **54MB Excel workbook** for smooth interactivity and fast filtering.
* **Analytical Modeling:** Created complex Pivot Tables and custom measures to analyze Year-over-Year (YoY) trends.
* **UI/UX Design:** Built a dark-themed, professional interface featuring dynamic slicers and custom icons for high scannability.

## 📊 Key Insights & KPIs

The dashboard provides a deep dive into **417,883 total casualties**:

### 🔑 Primary Performance Indicators

* **Severity Breakdown:** Detailed distribution of Fatal (1.7%), Serious (14.2%), and Slight (84.1%) casualties.
* **Vehicle Risk Analysis:** Identifies that Cars account for nearly **80% of all casualties** (333,485 cases).
* **Monthly Trends:** Comparative 2021 vs. 2022 trend lines to identify seasonal peaks in accidents.

### 🌍 Environmental & Infrastructure Factors

* **Road Surface:** Analysis of accidents across Dry, Wet, and Snow/Ice conditions.
* **Light Conditions:** Comparison of safety metrics during Daylight vs. Dark hours.
* **Location Analysis:** A "Rural vs. Urban" filter to help emergency services plan resource allocation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **`Road_Accident_Dashboard.xlsx`**: The core interactive file (Requires Excel Desktop for full functionality).
* **`.gitattributes`**: Configuration for **Git LFS** (Large File Storage) used to host the 54MB dataset.

## 🚀 How to Explore

1. **Download** the `.xlsx` file from this repository.
2. **Open in Excel Desktop** (Enable content/macros if prompted to allow slicers to work).
3. Use the **Filter Panels** on the bottom right to toggle between different accident scenarios.
